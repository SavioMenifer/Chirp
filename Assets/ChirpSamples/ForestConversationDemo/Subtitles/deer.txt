00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:05,369
Haha!

2
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:09,584
Well, Ms. Sparrow, I have to admit, I've always
envied your bird's eye view.

3
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:13,084
But with these hooves of mine, I think I'm
better off on the ground.

4
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:37,967
Mermaids?

5
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:41,346
Are you sure you're not confusing reality
with "The Little Mermaid" movie?

6
00:00:58,527 --> 00:00:59,771
Absolutely!

7
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:02,301
And I suppose it's best to stick to what we
know best.

8
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:06,612
I'll leave the flying to you, Sparrow, and
the deep-sea adventures to you, Squid.

9
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,000
Hahaha! It's settled then!

10
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:31,734
The Deer, the Sparrow, and the Squid, each
ruling their own domain.

11
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:35,031
Who would have thought we'd become the most
unique trio in the animal kingdom?

12
00:01:41,374 --> 00:01:45,307
Well, as long as we stick together, we'll
always have a good laugh.

13
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:47,134
Who knows what other adventures await us?
