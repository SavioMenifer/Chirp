00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,040
Excuse me, but I couldn't help
but overhear your conversation.

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,540
Flying and hooves? Ha! You both have no
idea what it's like to be underwater.

3
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,800
Queen, actually! And yes, the ocean
is my domain. You wouldn't believe

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,360
the incredible creatures I get to hang out
with. Sharks, whales, and even mermaids!

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, let's just say we have
our own versions of mermaids

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,400
down here. They might not sing as well, though.

7
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,000
Fair enough! Just remember, if you
ever get tired of your wings or hooves,

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,800
feel free to visit my underwater realm. I
might even teach you how to ink like a pro!

9
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,040
And the funniest, too! Let's not forget that part.

10
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,620
And ink-spiring punchlines, of course!
