00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:05.369
Haha!

00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:09.584
Well, Ms. Sparrow, I have to admit, I've always
envied your bird's eye view.

00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:13.084
But with these hooves of mine, I think I'm
better off on the ground.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:37.967
Mermaids?

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:41.346
Are you sure you're not confusing reality
with "The Little Mermaid" movie?

00:00:58.527 --> 00:00:59.771
Absolutely!

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:02.301
And I suppose it's best to stick to what we
know best.

00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:06.612
I'll leave the flying to you, Sparrow, and
the deep-sea adventures to you, Squid.

00:01:25.878 --> 00:01:28.000
Hahaha! It's settled then!

00:01:28.137 --> 00:01:31.734
The Deer, the Sparrow, and the Squid, each
ruling their own domain.

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:35.031
Who would have thought we'd become the most
unique trio in the animal kingdom?

00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:45.307
Well, as long as we stick together, we'll
always have a good laugh.

00:01:45.307 --> 00:01:47.134
Who knows what other adventures await us?
